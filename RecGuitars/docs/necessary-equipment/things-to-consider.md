#### Things to consider:

By design, this guide gives only a general overview of the type of software solutions available. Modeling sound and recording guitar tracks on a computer is a vast and complicated topic that deserves a separate in-depth insight. Generally, what you should bear in mind when choosing your software platform is:

- ease-of-use – music recording software, especially DAWs, tend to be complicated, even intimidating at first. Check free demo versions to see which works for you before paying full price.

- compatibility between the VST and DAW you choose – some DAWs don’t support third party VST plug-ins, or you have to pay extra for the functionality. 64-bit vs 32-bit compatibility issues also happen.

-  more complex DAWs enable you to use multiple VST plug-ins, provide advanced mixing options and process automation functions. It’s a whole universe to explore with a plethora of options, chances are you won’t need many of them – think and decide what really suits your purpose.

In the past, audio latency was an issue but on modern computer configurations it shouldn’t be a problem anymore for some years now.
