The easiest way to create your own preset is to choose a pre-defined one that generally fits your idea and modify it.

This top panel allows you to choose the virtual routing of your instrument signal. The paths are predefined 1 to 8 and the graph shows the path.

At the bottom of it, there is a panel for controlling signal level. Here you can see that I reduced the master volume by -6.3dB to avoid signal clipping.

To access amp, cab or effect settings click on the corresponding section in the top panel graph.

There are six effect slots available for Stomp A and six for Stomp B. You can pick an effect from the pop up list. The program offers a broad selection of them.
