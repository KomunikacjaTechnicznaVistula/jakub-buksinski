## **1. Hardware list**:

1. **Electric guitar/bass**

2. **Computer** (laptop or desktop) with USB connectivity

3. **Audio interface** with 6.3mm Jack socket for guitar recording

4. **Monitor speakers**. They donâ€™t have to be professional **studio monitors**. You can try using your home audio, preferably a stereo system.
   > IMPORTANT: **Audio reference setup** that you choose must have a line input, which is usually labelled **AUX** or **Line in** at the back of the unit. 

   > WARNING: Certain speaker types/audio setups might not be suitable - they can give inaccurate sound reference or get damaged - always control the output signal level and start from low volume to protect your audio equipment.

5. **Cords and cables with proper plugs**. It depends on your audio setup, but generally:
    - guitar cables have 6.3mm Jack plugs
    - cables connecting your computer or audio interface with studio monitors/audio reference system can have a single or double 6.3mm Jack or 3.5mm mini Jack plugs on the computer end, and single or double RCA/chinch plugs on the other end - depending on the sockets available in the audio unit. 
    - studio monitors use cables with 6.3mm Jack plugs
    - proprietary USB cables to connect your interface to computer should come with the device 
  
    > Remember to measure correct cable lengths to suit your needs!

6. **Optional:** Any guitar **stompboxes** you wish to use. You can use them without the guitar amp, plugged straight into the audio interface. Prepare an extra guitar cable and power source for each.
