## **4. How to record**

On a computer:

1. **Open your VST**, **set the guitar sound** you want. Save the preset.
2. **Open your DAW**, adjust the recording options, **embed the VST plug-in** into the track. Hit **record**, play to your heartâ€™s content. Stop, save the project.
3. **Record more tracks**, you may wish to loop and playback some of them to jam along or lay a solo. 
4. **Edit tracks** to suit your purposes. 
5. Have fun!
