## **Glossary**

**Amp modeling** - the process of emulating a physical guitar amplifier and applying it to the signal in order to recreate the sound of a specific amplifier model. Done by digital signal processing and used in guitar software.

**Audio in** - the input for the signal path in audio devices.

**Audio interface/Guitar interface/Recording interface** - a device connecting your guitar to computer and converting instrument signals into a format your computer and software recognize. The interface also routes audio from your computer out to your headphones and studio monitors/audio reference. Interfaces typically connect to your computer via USB cables.

**Audio latency** - a delay in the instrument signal reproduction introduced by digital processing. It shouldn’t be an issue on modern computer platforms using Windows 10 or newer.

**Audio out** - the output for the signal path in audio devices.

**Audio reference setup** - any speaker system chosen for presenting the sonic output of your guitar recording setup. Typically, it would be a stereo system with two passive speaker sets and amplification, essentially - your home audio. Alternatively, a more professional option would be active studio monitors designed for record production. 

**AUX** - an auxiliary port is a type of standard connector that accommodates audio signals on audio devices

**DAW workstation** - or digital audio workstation. It’s an electronic device or software used for recording, editing and producing audio files. DAWs come in a wide variety of configurations from a single software program on a laptop, to an integrated stand-alone unit. Regardless of configuration, modern DAWs have a central interface that allows the user to alter and mix multiple recordings and tracks into a final produced piece.

**Effect modeling** - the process of emulating a guitar effect pedal and applying it to the signal in order to recreate the sound of a specific guitar effect model. Done by digital signal processing and used in guitar software. It allows to create an effects chain, connecting multiple emulated effect devices in various configurations.

**Embedding the VST plug-in in DAW** - it essentially means connecting the track you record in DAW with a certain VST plug-in you want to use.

**Guitar effect pedals** - also known as stompboxes are foot-operated boxes that provide sound effects and tone shaping for electric guitars

**Jack plug** - 6.3mm Jack is the guitar/bass connector standard.

**Line in** - the input for the signal path in audio devices.

**Line out** - the output for the signal path in audio devices.

**mini Jack plug** - 3.5mm connector that is commonly used in home audio devices and headphones.

**Studio monitors** - Speaker sets specifically designed for professional audio production and meant to give the most accurate reproduction of the source audio tone. Compared to home audio speakers, the crucial technical difference is that they are active/powered speakers, with an amplifier enclosed in the speaker cabinet. They are built to cope with higher volumes and sound dynamics involved in the studio production.

**RCA plug** - or cinch. It's a connector commonly used to carry audio and video signals.

**Signal path** - the route a particular signal takes through a chain of electronic components on the way to its destination. In audio, it’s usually about connecting different pieces of equipment together and routing signals through them.

**Stompboxes** - also known as guitar effect pedals are foot operated boxes that provide sound effects and tone shaping for electric guitars.

**USB 2.0/3.x (type A)** - common connector standard for computer devices.

**USB C** - emerging new connector standard for computer devices.

**VST plug-in** - is an audio plug-in software interface that integrates software effects units into digital audio workstations. It uses digital signal processing to simulate traditional recording studio hardware in software. It allows you to model the guitar sounds in the way you want, providing amp modeling and effect modeling options. Numerous free and paid software options are available on the market.
